# JLPT-Migaku-Frequency-List
A JLPT frequency list compatible with the new Migaku extension sourced from [stephenmk's meta dictionary for Yomitan](https://github.com/stephenmk/yomitan-jlpt-vocab).

## Works great with
### [JLPT-Migaku-Progress-Tracker](https://github.com/FerchusGames/JLPT-Migaku-Progress-Tracker) 
JLPT progress tracker for Migaku users. Visualizes known, learning, and unknown words from Migaku word list exports with charts and clipboard integration. 

## Installation
This frequency list is available in two versions. Click the hyperlink below that best matches your needs:

### [Frequency List Only](https://github.com/FerchusGames/JLPT-Migaku-Frequency-List/releases/tag/frequency-list-only)
Choose this version if you only want to view the JLPT levels for each word.

### [With Recommended Sentences](https://github.com/FerchusGames/JLPT-Migaku-Frequency-List/releases/tag/with-recommended-sentences)
Choose this version if you also want to mine JLPT vocab sentences with Migaku's "Recommended Sentences" feature to prepare for an exam.

## How it works
Migaku gives stars to each word in a frequency list based on their position:

- 1st - 1500th element: 5 stars
- 1501st - 5000th: 4 stars 
- 5001st - 15000th: 3 stars
- 15001st - 30000th: 2 stars
- 30001st+: 1 star

There are a lot of empty elements in the list to make up the space between each level. The source I used had 705 words for JLPT 5, so I added 795 empty elements to make it to the start of JLPT4 and so on.
